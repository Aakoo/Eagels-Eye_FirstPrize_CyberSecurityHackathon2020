Within the context of the Cyber Security Hackathon to fight hate crimes and violent extremism online. We developed in a 24Hours Hackathon a Poc (Proof of concept) of continuous monitoring platform that scrapes data form social media channels, analyses post to detect whether or not it can be classified as Hate Violent Extremism Speech, Thanks to a prediction, machine learning algorithm PoC we developed on the spot. All suspect cases will be visualized with an approximate address of the location of the felony so that the authorities can take immediate action.
The platform also contains a social help Hub, a social network of mental health specialists talking with anonymous people who can be struggling at the moment or getting a bad influence.
